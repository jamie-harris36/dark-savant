This is the documentation for Dark Savant's new website. It has been built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Javascript as part of Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development Course.

## Project Development & Planning

Throughout the development of this project, I followed the principles of User Experience (UX). This included the five elements of
UX design:

1. Strategy
2. Scope
3. Structure
4. Skeleton
5. Surface

My aim was to ensure the website was easy to use and responsive, as well as fulfilling the needs of the user.

### Project Goals

#### **Project Purpose**

Dark Savant, a Nottingham based metal band, need an updated and redesigned website to promote the band's latest tour dates, news and merchandise.

#### **Client Background**

Dark Savant is a Doom Metal band based in Nottingham, UK. The band play arena shows all over the UK and Europe. They also have three studio albums and sell a wide range of merchandise and apparel, including T-shirts, hoodies, hats and other accessories. The music that the band play range from hard rock, heavy metal and also with a hint of soft ballads.

#### **Client Goals**

- To sell tickets for their arena shows to their fans.
- To sell band merchandise to their fans, which will also raise brand awareness.
- To prompt fans and potential fans to listen to their music on streaming services.
- To share information and latest news about the band to their fans and potential fans.
- To invite people to sign up for email updates, where the band can further promote news, shows, releases and merchandise.
- To attract new fans.

#### **User Goals**

The website will be for various types of users with different motivations:

- Fans that want to know if the band will be playing a show in their city.
- Fans that want to buy a ticket for a show.
- Fans that want to listen to official music releases.
- Fans that want to buy official band merchandise.
- Fans that want to read the latest band news.
- Fans that want to keep up to date by signing up to the band's email list.

### Design, Layout & Structure

#### **Structure**

The site has a simple structure, made up of 14 pages:

- Homepage - The main hub page, consisting of a summary of each individual section.
- Tour Page - More detailed information about the band's tour dates and a way for fans to buy tickets.
- News Page - More detailed information about the band's latest news, including the following articles:
    - New Album - Information about the latest album release, and a way to listen on streaming services.
    - Tour Announced - Information about the latest European tour, and more information on how to book tickets.
    - New Merch - Information about the latest apparel released and information on how to buy from the shop.
- Music Page - Information about the studio album releases and links to listen to them on streaming services.
- Video Page - A page containing embedded lyric videos that are hosted on YouTube.
- Merch Page - A page containing merch item listings, the prices of each item and links to buy them on an external website.
- There are also 5 additional sub pages.
    - Privacy Policy - Information about the privacy policy.
    - Terms of Use - Information about the terms of use.
    - Cookies Policy - Information about the cookies policy.
    - Thank You Page - Where the user is directed to when they use the sign up form.
    - 404 Error Page - Where the user is directed when they land on a non-existant page.

The site has a nav menu at the top of the page, containing social media icons. These icons link to the band's official social media pages. This menu also appears in the site's footer. The site also has a main nav menu, contained underneath the band logo on desktop and tablet view, however on mobile view, the main nav menu and social media menu appear only when the menu toggle icon(three horizontal lines located on the top right hand corner of the page) is clicked. When the menu toggle icon is clicked, the menus will appear over a plain black background which covers the entire screen, and will only go back to normal when the menu toggle icon (now a cross shaped icon) is clicked again.

On the homepage, there is a header image that covers the entire screen, also known as 'above the fold' and in order to see any further content, the user is required to scroll down. The homepage is the only page where this header image is seen. On every other page, the content is positioned directly underneath the main nav menu.

There is also a footer on every page, containing the social media nav menu, links to legal pages, and a copyright notice.

**Colours**

I have used the following colours as part of this website's colour pallette:

- #a180a9
- #6f279c
- #49328a
- #343a40
- #a1a1a1
- #000000
- #eeeeee
- #ffffff

**Fonts**

I imported Google Fonts and used Alegreya (with a fallback of Sans Serif) for the main body font. I feel this goes well with the dark theme the band is looking for.

### Code
