This is the documentation for Dark Savant's new website. It has been built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Javascript as part of Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development Course.

## Project Development & Planning

Throughout the development of this project, I followed the principles of User Experience (UX). This included the five elements of
UX design:

1. Strategy
2. Scope
3. Structure
4. Skeleton
5. Surface

My aim was to ensure the website was easy to use and responsive, as well as fulfilling the needs of the user.

#### **Structure**

The site has a simple structure, made up of 14 pages:

- Homepage - The main hub page, consisting of a summary of each individual section.
- Tour Page - More detailed information about the band's tour dates and a way for fans to buy tickets.
- News Page - More detailed information about the band's latest news, including the following articles:
    - New Album - Information about the latest album release, and a way to listen on streaming services.
    - Tour Announced - Information about the latest European tour, and more information on how to book tickets.
    - New Merch - Information about the latest apparel released and information on how to buy from the shop.
- Music Page - Information about the studio album releases and links to listen to them on streaming services.
- Video Page - A page containing embedded lyric videos that are hosted on YouTube.
- Merch Page - A page containing merch item listings, the prices of each item and links to buy them on an external website.
- There are also 5 additional sub pages.
    - Privacy Policy - Information about the privacy policy.
    - Terms of Use - Information about the terms of use.
    - Cookies Policy - Information about the cookies policy.
    - Thank You Page - Where the user is directed to when they use the sign up form.
    - 404 Error Page - Where the user is directed when they land on a non-existant page.

The site has a nav menu at the top of the page, containing social media icons. These icons link to the band's official social media pages. This menu also appears in the site's footer. The site also has a main nav menu, contained underneath the band logo on desktop and tablet view, however on mobile view, the main nav menu and social media menu appear only when the menu toggle icon(three horizontal lines located on the top right hand corner of the page) is clicked. When the menu toggle icon is clicked, the menus will appear over a plain black background which covers the entire screen, and will only go back to normal when the menu toggle icon (now a cross shaped icon) is clicked again.

On the homepage, there is a header image that covers the entire screen, also known as 'above the fold' and in order to see any further content, the user is required to scroll down. The homepage is the only page where this header image is seen. On every other page, the content is positioned directly underneath the main nav menu.

There is also a footer on every page, containing the social media nav menu, links to legal pages, and a copyright notice.

#### **Colours**

I have used the following colours as part of this website's colour pallette:

- #a180a9
- #6f279c
- #49328a
- #343a40
- #a1a1a1
- #000000
- #eeeeee
- #ffffff

#### **Fonts**

I imported Google Fonts and used Alegreya (with a fallback of Sans Serif) for the main body font. I feel this goes well with the dark theme the band is looking for.

## Testing & Bugs

### Responsiveness

The site was tested on the following devices:

- HP Laptop
- Samsung Galaxy A5
- Google Chrome Developer Tools - simulator for many different devices and varying screen sizes, as well as the adjustable sizing options.

### Clickable Links

- Each clickable link has been tested and made sure they go to the correct places. 
- Each external link opens up in a new tab so the user isn't directed away from the website.
- It should be noted that any external links to buy tickets, buy merch or listen to albums aren't real, as the tours, merch and albums are made up. The buttons to buy tickets, merch and stream albums direct the user to [Ticketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.com/), [Merchbar](https://www.merchbar.com/), and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) respectively.

### Email Form

- I tested the email form several times, using the Code Institute form dump page as a template, but made the mistake when I added my own Thank You page of keeping "POST METHOD". Once I changed to "GET METHOD" the form worked fine. 

### Video Player

- I tried to find a way to make the video player change the video source when the relevant thumbnail is clicked. I used a tutorial (mentioned below) and adapted the code. There was a lot of trial and error involved.
